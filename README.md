# ReordableViews

This is an experimental Swift Package that implements "reorder on drag" behaviour for SwiftUI views. I made this since I didn't like the SwiftUI's inbuilt drag and drop implementation. 

The main component of the package is `ReordableForEach` struct which is very similar to `ForEach`.
If you want to use it, see docs in the code or the example app.
